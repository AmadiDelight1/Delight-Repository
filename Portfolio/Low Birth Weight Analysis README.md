## Analysis Overview
Low birth weight is defined as a birthweight of less than 2,500 grams. it is a critical global health challenge that significantly contributes to infant morbidity, mortality and long-term developmental complications. This analysis aims to identify disparities, highlight progress, expose trends in prevalence and case counts over time and pinpoint areas lagging in LBW reduction. Drawing imsights from this analysis will guide interventions to improve maternal and child health and will accelerate progress towards reducing the global burden of low birth weight.
