## Problem Statement
Lagos, one of Africa’s fastest-growing coastal cities, faces increasing flood risks driven by climate change, rapid urbanization, poor drainage infrastructure, and changing weather patterns. Each year, intense rainfall and rising sea levels lead to widespread flooding, damaging homes, roads, and public utilities and in many cases costing lives.

Despite the scale of the problem, flood management strategies in many urban centers remain largely reactive rather than proactive. Limited access to actionable weather insights makes it difficult for policymakers, urban planners, and disaster response agencies to anticipate high-risk periods or implement timely interventions. As a result, the city continues to experience recurring human, social, and economic losses that could be mitigated with better data-driven decision-making.

## Analysis Overview
This project was designed to investigate flood trends, identify key weather variables, uncover seasonal risk patterns, and generate actionable insights that can guide short-term mitigation and long-term adaptation strategies. By analysing over a decade of weather data (2010–2024), the project leverages data analytics and visualization to translate complex meteorological information into practical intelligence for decision-makers, city planners, emergency responders, and environmental stakeholders with the ultimate goal of saving lives, reducing vulnerability, and strengthening urban resilience.

## Data Source
The dataset was collected from UNICEF/WHO LBW estimate cases, transformed in google sheet and extracted to Power BI in PDF format.

## Preparation Tools
  - Power Query: This was used to extract, clean, shape, pivot and unpivot data. Also, it was used to develop a pipeline that cut manual processing from 4 hours to 20 minutes
  - Power BI: This was to create visuals that solve specific problems and real time insights that drives accurate decision making.
