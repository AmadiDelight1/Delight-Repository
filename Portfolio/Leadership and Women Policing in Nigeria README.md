## Analysis Overview
----
This research investigates the dynamics of women leadership participation within the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) from 2015 to 2024. Drawing on survey data from 569 respondents, the study explores key factors influencing leadership advancement among women, examines prevalent workplace challenges, and highlights respondentsâ€™ policy recommendations and reform priorities. The findings reveal persistent gender inequality, institutional bias, and cultural stereotypes as primary barriers to womenâ€™s leadership progression. However, emerging support for gender quotas and equal opportunity reforms indicates a gradual shift toward inclusive leadership practices.

## Preparation Tools
----
  - Power Query: The extraction, cleaning and transformation of the dataset was carried using Python in Power Query.
  - Power BI: This was to create analytical visuals that solve and answers specific problems that drives accurate decision making.
    
----

## Data Processing
----
Data Transformation in Power Query: The following process was taken to prepare data for analysis:
  - Removing data duplicates
  - Removing errors
  - Standardization of data
  - Removing null values and blanks
  - Append tables

----

Data Modelling: A star schema relationship was created for the fact table and calendar table, and the data was permanently stored as direct query to enhance performance during automation.

Measures: The key measures created includes:
- A total of 569 officers participated in the research survey, providing a strong representation across ranks and regions.
- Policy Promotion Support (32%) shows that only a third of respondents believe that existing policies sufficiently promote womenâ€™s advancement. This indicates a significant policy perception gap within the institution.
- Gender Quota Support (36%) reveals growing acceptance of structured gender inclusion mechanisms such as quotas, although uptake remains moderate.
- Harassment Report Rate (34%) suggests that one-third of women have either experienced or witnessed workplace harassment an alarming figure that underscores the need for stronger internal accountability systems.

## Objective
----
The primary objectives of this research are to:
- Analyze the level of policy and gender quota support for female leadership in the NPF.

## Insights

Top Policy Recommendations by Respondents:

The chart show that the most frequent recommendation among respondents is Policy Reform (203 responses), highlighting the demand for a complete structural overhaul of gender-related policies within the NPF. Following this, Equal Opportunities (132) and Training & Mentorship (124) were emphasized, indicating that female officers want fair promotion processes and access to professional development. Representation and Visibility (76) and Fair Posting (62) reflect concerns about how leadership opportunities and assignments are distributed.

These insights collectively point to an institutional system where policy gaps, training deficits, and representation issues are limiting womenâ€™s progression. Implementing reforms around equality and mentorship could therefore serve as high-impact interventions.

Key Challenges Faced by Women in the NPF:

The bar chart shows that the top challenge is Unequal Opportunities which was mwntioned 1,167 a clear indication that promotion, leadership visibility, and task allocation are still largely male-dominated. Work-Life Balance (805) ranks second, showing that family and social pressures continue to hinder female officers career continuity.
Cultural Bias (302) and Political Gaps (275) highlight deeply rooted institutional biases and weak policy enforcement, while Training Deficiencies (288) and Sexual Harassment (275) underscore the lack of adequate support systems.

These data points emphasize that the challenge is multi-layered â€” cultural, institutional, and personal, requiring a holistic reform approach rather than isolated initiatives.

Key Factors Influencing Women Leadership Participation

The Factor analaysis represented using Heat map visually separates the core challenges into three major clusters:
â€¢	Cultural Factors (e.g., Culltural Bias) shows persistent social barriers that shape leadership perception.
â€¢	Institutional Factors (e.g., Unequal opportunities, Political Gaps) ponits to organizational practices that need reform.
â€¢	Personal Factors (e.g., Work life balance and limited training access) emphasizes the individual impact of systemic bias.

This heatmap confirms that womenâ€™s leadership participation is not hindered by capability but by systemic and cultural constraints. Addressing these factors holistically can unlock leadership potential and institutional trust.

## Conclusion

----

The findings from the Leadership and Women Policing in Nigeria (2015â€“2024) study reveal both progress and persistent gaps in achieving gender equity in the NPF. While awareness and advocacy have increased, tangible policy action and leadership inclusion remain limited. Addressing the institutional and cultural factors identified in this study is essential to building a more equitable, effective, and representative police leadership structure in Nigeria.
